# Current Monitoring Stack Implementation

**Implementation Date:** July 2025  
**Platform:** Ubuntu VM on work computer  
**Status:** ✅ Functional monitoring stack deployed  

## Overview

This documents my first hands-on monitoring stack implementation using Docker containers. The setup successfully collects and visualizes system metrics.

## What's Currently Working

### Components Deployed
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana** - Data visualization with custom dashboards
- **Node Exporter** - System metrics collection

### Dashboards Created
1. **Node Exporter Full Dashboard**
   - CPU utilization monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Disk space monitoring
   - Network traffic visualization
   - System load metrics

### Key Achievements
- Successfully deployed containerized monitoring stack
- Created professional system monitoring dashboards
- Implemented persistent data storage for metrics
- Configured Prometheus to scrape Node Exporter metrics
- Built comprehensive system overview visualizations

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Prometheus    │◄───│  Node Exporter  │
│   :9090         │    │    :9100        │
└─────────┬───────┘    └─────────────────┘

└─────────────────┘
```

## Configuration

### Docker Compose Setup
```yaml
# Monitoring stack deployed using Docker containers
# Components: Prometheus (latest), Grafana (latest), Node Exporter (latest)
# Configuration managed through Docker Compose
```

### Access Points
- **Grafana Dashboard:** http://localhost:3000
- **Prometheus Web UI:** http://localhost:9090

## Technical Implementation Details

### What I Learned
- Docker Compose is effective for multi-container applications
- Grafana requires Prometheus as a data source configuration
- Node Exporter provides comprehensive system metrics
- Dashboard creation requires understanding of metric queries
- Persistent volumes are essential for data retention

### Challenges Solved
- Container networking configuration
- Data source configuration in Grafana
- Dashboard panel creation and customization
- Metric query construction

## Current Capabilities

### Metrics Being Monitored
- CPU usage across multiple cores
- Memory utilization and availability
- Disk space usage and I/O
- Network interface traffic
- System load averages

### Visualizations Created
- Real-time gauge charts for key metrics
- Time series graphs for historical data
- Color-coded status indicators
- Multi-panel dashboard layout

## Next Steps for Enhancement

- [ ] Explore AlertManager integration for notifications
- [ ] Add cAdvisor for container-specific monitoring
- [ ] Implement custom alert rules
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Migrate to production-ready environment

## Migration Planning

### Files to Transfer
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- Grafana configuration and dashboards
- Prometheus configuration files
- Any custom configuration files

### Migration Strategy
- Export Grafana dashboards as JSON
- Document current configuration settings
- Prepare clean deployment process
- Test in new environment before full migration
